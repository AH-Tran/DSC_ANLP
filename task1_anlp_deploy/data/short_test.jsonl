The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months.", "According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it’s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\"", "Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it’s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy’s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon’s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game.", "Cawthon’s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn’t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn’t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.", "Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy’s games early, and it wouldn’t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon’s post to the contrary.", "With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location‘s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.", "Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.", "Source: Scott Cawthon"], "targetTitle": "Five Nights at Freddy’s Sequel Delayed for Weird Reason", "targetDescription": "Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series.", "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-UeXruRVtZz7w6.gif", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-3.png", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets-700x389.jpg", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-Cover-Art.jpg", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-clown-animatronic-700x389.png", "https://gamerant.com/wp-content/themes/9.0/images/logo-4.jpg"], "targetUrl": "https://gamerant.com/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-delay/?utm_content=inf_124_3412_2&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=SocialEdge&tse_id=INF_e34a10a08b0811e6b6db4d0235f40af5", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "They think It's too dark. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Gaming"}, "spoiler": ["some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick"], "spoilerPositions": [[[2, 158], [2, 236]]], "tags": ["passage"]}

On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona’s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges.", "Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow’s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio’s violations of his orders were intentional.", "In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio.", "\"The Defendants’ unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote.", "In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice.", "Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people.", "He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly.", "In Friday’s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count.", "\"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\"", "In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America’s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge.", "A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow’s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn’t want to see Arpaio reelected.", "Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff’s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined.", "In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos.", "Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives.", "Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign.", "\"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the

Thank us later — no tip necessary.", "If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you’re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what’s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment.", "Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along.", "As for your stylist’s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20.", "\"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle.", "Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it’s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.", "Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.", "If you’re a woman with shorter hair — meaning you get it cut and/or colored regularly — your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client’s.", "As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!", "Finally, if you’re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip.

It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa.", "HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project.

I wanted to just try it; it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I’ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it’s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I’m enjoying it.", "Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie?", "Rickman: I wasn’t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn’t know about it and didn’t know its history. I hadn’t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it’s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they’d all started in a club on the Bowery.", "Grint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn’t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn’t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible.", "Did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie?", "Rickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn’t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the ‘60s and the ‘70s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that.", "Grint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that.", "Did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point?", "Grint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me.", "Not knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters?", "Rickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me.", "Grint: Yeah, there wasn’t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you’re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it’s quite a challenge.", "So he was on set the whole time?", "Grint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive.", "Did he give you any notes while filming?", "Grint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time.", "Was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera?", "Grint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.", "Were you comfortable with that? How did that go down?", "Grint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn’t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn’t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don’t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There’s quite a lot of ass in the film.", "You had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera?", "Rickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That’s really difficult.", "Grint: It’s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It’s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things.", "Once you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying?", "Grint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I’ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music.", "Is music something you’d ever pursue?", "Grint: I don’t know, probably not. I’ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it’s never going to happen.", "Alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character?", "Rickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I’ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It’s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I’m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in \"Sense & Sensibility\" as I am any of those powerful characters. It’s just part of an actor’s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard.", "How was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth \"Harry Potter\" movie?", "Rickman: No, because I think we’d both been so busy doing other things. But it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. I saw Emma [Watson] the other night in London in a restaurant, and I saw Daniel [Radcliffe] recently in London because he was doing a play. It’s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image.", "Grint: Not really, no, actually. ... I love Alan. He’s always been one of my favorites. But yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- I’m trying to think back -- I don’t think I ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak.", "Which \"Potter\" co-star would you most like to reunite with?", "Grint: There are so many. All of them. I’ve already loved working with them. I like Michael Gambon. He’s so cool; just a remarkable guy. I’ve worked with Julie Walters before as well. I love her, she’s great.", "Now for something more fun. It's October. What's your favorite Halloween costume you've ever worn?", "Rickman: [Laughs] The thing about Halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it’s so different in England –- we used to have something called Bonfire Night, and we’d have fireworks. That’s disappeared and I know Halloween’s taken over. Halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you’d have apple bobbing in it, and you’d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt.", "Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh?", "Of course.", "Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It’s not very practical.", "Do you have a favorite Halloween candy?", "Rickman: I don’t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large.", "Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don’t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that’s a big thing. I’ve tried that.

Rowling‘s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn’t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.", "Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort’s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from ‘lasting more than a year’. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term’s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn’t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn’t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall’s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?", "As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall’s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort’s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore’s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle’s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.", "Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall’s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?", "Take note of Professor McGonagall’s wand. It’s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, ‘the survivor’s wand,’ because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.", "It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore’s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration.

Abrams has an answer on if there will be a post-credits scene in the new 'Star Wars'"], "postPlatform": "Twitter", "targetParagraphs": ["In the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular. The films made by Marvel Studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the \"X-Men\" franchise movies as well as the latest \"Terminator.\" Because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the \"Star Wars\" series as well... but now J.J. Abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation.", "The subject came up when Abrams was on stage for a \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" press conference held today in Los Angeles. The filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or Easter Egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying:", "\"No, there’s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\"", "Those of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn’t happening – so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.", "Post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits – but I can’t say that I’m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won’t have one. After all, they aren’t exactly part of the franchise’s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it’s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it.", "Surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they’ll all get over it fairly quickly. After all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we’re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" As always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and J.J.

But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?", "The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.", "Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.", "In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.", "By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.", "The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.", "\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.", "Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.", "Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.", "\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.", "His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.", "If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.", "Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.", "Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.", "Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas.

Well maybe now we’ve sparked your curiosity.", "They don’t fart—detectably. There’s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn’t seem like anyone has ever truly observed—or more importantly, measured—a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?", "As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don’t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird’s gastrointestinal tract, he’d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.", "But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there’s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.", "In another blog post, she describes the only written account she’s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master’s thesis on blue jays.", "One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.", "Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod’s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor—steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog’s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)", "It’s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components—namely sulfur. So if birds don’t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn’t smell it.", "Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers.", "But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?", "As far as we could tell, this isn’t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab’s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he’s never personally noticed a bird fart.", "Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird’s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one’s feathers."], "targetTitle": "Do birds fart?", "targetDescription": null, "targetKeywords": null, "targetMedia": ["https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/15c/ce/Screenshot202017-02-2620at2010.41.5720AM-500x250.png", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/logo_black.png", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/kernel-logo.png", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/dailydot/img/logo_white.png", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/69e/73/f7e3ca23be3c34b64675b7e636214a25.jpg", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/961/ed/13443e61fc64c27236ad91a76c23c7e2-500x250.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://cdn.relaymedia.com/ping?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fparsec%2Fdo-birds-fart%2F", "https://19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/1ee/4d/167e61f4ead95121-500x250.jpg"], "targetUrl": "http://www.dailydot.com/geek/do-birds-fart/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss", "provenance": {"source": "anonymized", "humanSpoiler": "No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. #StopClickBait", "spoilerPublisher": "Stop Clickbait - Science"}, "spoiler": ["They don’t fart"], "spoilerPositions": [[[1, 0], [1, 15]]], "tags": ["phrase"]}

Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says.

If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court.", "But when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand.", "As always, he would do it for Jeanie.", "This time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead.", "Jackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture.", "It did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.", "The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry.", "So now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. If they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships.", "As the years went by, Jackson focused in on the Knicks and Buss focused on the Lakers. He would come to Los Angeles when he could, and she would see him in New York when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect.", "Both of their legacies are tied to what they do next. Buss must decide whether to reboot the Lakers' front office. Jackson needs to make the Knicks into a contender. Those close to Jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the Knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer.", "There had been speculation that Jackson could return to the Lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from New York. Those are the types of implausible things that happen in Camelot.", "It was never meant to be.", "Buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. She also has maintained close ties with first-year coach Luke Walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous Lakers coaches. Those close to Buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office.", "All of those are massive things, that Jackson and Buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles.", "So the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end Tuesday night. Camelot was over."], "targetTitle": "Phil and Jeanie -- basketball's ultimate power couple -- call it quits", "targetDescription": "Despite so many tangled webs, Phil Jackson and Jeanie Buss made it work for 17 years.
