It commonly happens as we are waking up and this is called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep. This occurs because during sleep we shift through different stages such REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During NREM stage, we sleep deeply, this is when the body does its rejuvenating by relaxing muscles. This is followed by the REM stage where our brain has similar activity as when we are awake. REM is characterised by rapid side to side eye movements and detailed, vivid dreams but the body remains in lockdown mode to prevent us from acting out these dreams as they could prove dangerous. Sometimes our brain becomes aware before we slip out of the REM phase and that's when we cannot move or speak.'. First Spoiler: 16. Spoiler Length Ratio: 10.875. 7 organisations. 3 persons. 3 dates.

Because slow-moving water can’t carry as much weight as fast-moving water, loose dirt and rocks build up on that side, making it more shallow. Eventually, the build-up creates new land and a new curve in the river’s watercourse. The new curve causes the water running against the outside bank to pick up enough momentum that it slams into the opposite bank further down the river, creating another curve. As more time passes, the rushing water creates more and more curves downstream.'. First Spoiler: 3. Spoiler Length Ratio: 33.25. 2 organisations. 2 persons. 1 dates. 4 locations.
